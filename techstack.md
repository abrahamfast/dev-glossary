# 🚀 Tech Stack - Understanding the Technology Behind Software  

A **Tech Stack** is the combination of programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools used to develop and run an application. It consists of multiple layers, typically divided into **Front-end, Back-end, Database, and Infrastructure/DevOps**.  

## 📚 Key Components of a Tech Stack  

### **1️⃣ Front-end (User Interface)**
The technologies responsible for what users see and interact with in an application.  
- [HTML & CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) – Structure and styling of web pages  
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) – Adds interactivity to websites  
- [React](https://react.dev/) – A popular front-end JavaScript library  
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) – A progressive front-end framework  
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) – A TypeScript-based front-end framework  
- [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) – High-performance code execution in browsers  

### **2️⃣ Back-end (Server-Side Logic)**
Handles the logic, processing, and communication with the database.  
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) – JavaScript runtime for server-side applications  
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) – Popular for dynamic web applications  
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) – Used for backend APIs and data processing  
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) – High-performance, memory-safe backend programming  

### **3️⃣ Database (Storage & Management)**
Stores and retrieves application data efficiently.  
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) – A popular relational database  
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) – A NoSQL document-based database  
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) – An in-memory database for caching  
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) – Advanced relational database with JSON support  

### **4️⃣ Infrastructure & DevOps**
Tools for deployment, scaling, and server management.  
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) – Containerization for easy deployment  
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) – Automates container orchestration  
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) / [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) / [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) – Cloud hosting solutions  
- [CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Deployment)](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery)

## 📌 Choosing the Right Tech Stack  
Selecting the right tech stack depends on:  
✅ **Project requirements** (Web app, Mobile app, AI, etc.)  
✅ **Performance & scalability** (Real-time processing, Big data)  
✅ **Development speed** (Rapid prototyping vs. enterprise solutions)  
✅ **Team expertise** (Tech familiarity & learning curve)
